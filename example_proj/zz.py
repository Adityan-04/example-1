This comprehensive platform will provide enterprise-level document analysis, AI-powered insights, and collaborative features for teams working with large document collections.Build a complete enterprise-level AI platform called DocuSage AI that allows users to upload, analyze, and query documents and websites using a hybrid RAG system (FAISS + BM25). Include OCR for scanned PDFs, multilingual support, and citation-backed contextual answers. Add multi-agent reasoning, cross-document comparison, web monitoring, knowledge graph visualization, AI summarization, auto-report generation, and team collaboration. Use React + Tailwind + Framer Motion for a glassmorphism UI, and Node.js (or FastAPI) with MongoDB, FAISS, and OpenAI/HuggingFace models for the backend. Provide a 3D animated dashboard, voice input, smart notifications, and admin analytics. Ensure modular architecture, secure data handling, and enterprise scalability.”
